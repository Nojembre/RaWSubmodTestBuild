MBEXECUTIVE_TACTICAL_DEMO,Located in the Moddell sector of the Outer Rim, this silvery gas giant planet is orbited by nine moons. The largest moon is the size of a small planet and is known as the forest moon or simply Endor. It is covered by savannas, mountains and woodlands with trees that reach thousands of meters in height. A wide range of intelligent creatures inhabit Endor, from the vicious and towering Gorax to the courageous Ewoks. The Ewoks build their sprawling villages in Endor's trees that are connected by suspended bridges, ropes and wooden platforms. Ewoks are deceptively innocuous, but are keen warriors and hunters capable of using their ingenuity and natural surroundings to their advantage.
MBEXECUTIVE_TACTICAL_DEMO1,A temperate planet in the Chommell Sector of the Mid Rim, Naboo is covered by thick swamps, rolling plains, and green hills. Unlike many other planets, Naboo lacks a molten core. Instead, the planet's innards are composed of a massive honeycomb structure filled with water. The planet is also home to numerous animal species and is inhabited by the peaceful Naboo and the more warlike Gungans. The Naboo typically populate striking cities such as Theed, while the Gungans dwell in exotic bubble cities hidden in lakes and swamps. Both the Naboo and the Gungans oppose the Emperor.

TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_21_INTRO_U,The galaxy is in turmoil following the Battle of Yavin.  Many of the planetary governments have seceded from the Empire, but are not ready to trust the Rebellion.

They are isolated and far from the Empire's center at Coruscant, and as a result are more used to freedom and the temptations that only the Consortium can provide.  If we control the Rim, we complete a noose around the galaxy that we can then slowly constrict, choking the rest of the Empire.

TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_00,Word comes to us that the inhabitants of one of the Empire's systems are revolting against their Imperial oppressors.  They will not last long against the heartless destruction of the Empire.  Act quickly, commander, as time is of the essence.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_01,We’ve received a distress call from a planet revolting against the Empire.  More and more innocents die every second we do not help them.  The entire populace will soon be wiped out if we do not respond.  Make haste commander.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_02,This is a sad day, commander.  Word comes to us that the revolt against the Empire has surrendered.  Their losses were too great to continue to fight.  It’s a shame we were unable to help them in their time of need.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_03,We have been contacted by the leader of the revolt.  The entire populace of the planet is forever indebted to us.  If ever the Empire strikes at their planet again, they will rise to help us.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_TITLE,Indigenous Revolt
TEXT_MON_EVENT_OPPRESSION_01,We have received a distress call that cannot be ignored.  The Empire has conquered yet another planet and the people are suffering greatly.  If we help, they have promised us that a local smuggler and bounty hunter will do our bidding in the future.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_OPPRESSION_02,Your actions prove your true loyalty to the Alliance and the galaxy.  There are many here who wish to serve under your command.  A smuggler and a bounty hunter have been reassigned to your command.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_OPPRESSION_TITLE,Empire Oppression
TEXT_MON_EVENT_PLANET_OWNERSHIP_FLIP_00,One of our allied planets has betrayed us.  It has come to our attention that the system’s leaders have been cooperating with the Empire for some time now.  The system is a great loss to the Alliance.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_PLANET_WINDFALL_00,Our influences have reached one of the Empire's planets.  They have decided to revolt and join our cause.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_TECH_WINDFALL_00,You have done well.  We have some new tech available for you - It should help us in the struggle.  Your tech level has been raised one level.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UNIT_WINDFALL_00,I am grateful for your presence, commander.  We have reallocated some units to your service.  I'm sure you will put them to good use.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UNITS_00,A base alone cannot protect worlds from the Empire - Fleets, ground troops and secondary structures all play a part in defense.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UNITS_01,You have done well in building our forces.  I have decided to allocate more funding to you.  Use these credits wisely.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_00,You are doing well, but our defenses need to be even stronger.  Upgrade one of our star bases to strengthen our defenses.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_01,Your actions have strengthened our position in the galaxy. Word of your actions has spread and donations continue to flow in.  Use these credits wisely.

Plagued by volcanic activity, Aeten II is known for its deposits of rare stygium crystals, which are used in the construction of cloaking devices. Because stygium crystals are extremely valuable, a number of unscrupulous prospectors descended upon Aeten II, where they competed for the rare crystals with deadly abandon. As a result, Aeten II became one of the most dangerous planets in the Outer Rim territories.Currently, Aeten II's cache of crystals had been all but depleted, making the manufacture of new stygium-based cloaking devices a near impossibility. Prospectors looking to retool old mining facilities here have since found other valuable resources to mine.

Though most of Skako is covered by urban sprawl, some examples of the planet's original ecosystem had been preserved in the form of vast fields of sprawling vines. Skako was also home to the Octuptarras—eight-eyed creatures with gasbag-shaped heads and multiple legs—that inhabited the planet's vines.Few Skakoans invested in the protective Skakoan pressure suit required for traveling offworld, and thus the species was relatively rare abroad.

TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_,[TBL]
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_10A_INTRO_E,Imperial defenses are failing throughout the galaxy; only three planets still belong to the Empire, and they are weak and undefended.  If the Empire is to survive, you must push back the Rebel offensive.  You will be granted 5,000 initial credits for the strengthening of your forces.  Beware of outlying Pirate-controlled worlds who stand in your way.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_10A_INTRO_R,Only a small group of systems remain under Imperial control, and war has taken its toll on the galaxy.  As a result, both sides must build from the ground up to advance.  Use the 5,000 starting credits to remove the remains of the Empire from the galaxy.  Beware of outlying pirate-controlled systems in the galaxy that hold no ties with either side.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_10B_INTRO_E,Research has been completed on the Death Star project.  Use the provided 8,000 credits to construct the battle station as soon as possible.  Be sure to build additional forces to compliment the Death Star on its maiden voyage.  Upon completion, you are to eliminate the Rebel threat from the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_10B_INTRO_R,The Empire is constructing a massive, mobile superweapon platform that is capable of destroying entire planets.  You will have 8,000 credits at your disposal.  Your mission is to destroy the Death Star at any cost.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_15_INTRO_E,The Empire has already completed the construction of several Star Destroyers at the Kuat Drive Yards.  The Rebellion has upgraded their starbases in preparation for the upcoming battles.  You have 15,000 credits at your disposal; use this to utterly destroy the Rebellion.  You must complete this task within 20 days, or they will scatter to the ends of the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_15_INTRO_R,Reports have surfaced that the Empire is dedicating most of their production to building Star Destroyers at the Kuat shipyards.  The Empire cannot be allowed to gain a production advantage in space.  Use this 8,000 credits allocated to aid you in taking control of Fondor, Fresia and Kuat.  You must hurry; if you cannot complete your task in 20 days, all will be lost.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_20_INTRO_E,The Empire's foothold in the galaxy has been compromised.  Pirates have run rampant across many systems.  Use your initial 3,000 credits to secure control of both the Pirate and Rebel-controlled planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_20_INTRO_R,The Empire is weak from corruption; most of their systems have been overrun with pirates.  You must lead the Alliance forces into battle against the Pirates and the remains of the Empire. You will begin with 4,000 credits; use it liberate the remaining planets in the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_25_INTRO_E,This Rebellion has subverted many of the outlying systems of the galaxy and the Empire is in dire peril of losing Coruscant.  Imperial forces have pulled back and fortified the Core Worlds, but it is only a matter of time before the Rebels begin their assault.  A sum total of 9,000 credits has been made available to you.  Rebuild the Imperial Navy, destroy the Rebels, and protect the Emperor at all costs.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_25_INTRO_R,The Alliance controls most of the outlying worlds of the galaxy. Now is the time to strike at the heart of the Empire: Emperor Palpatine must be removed from power, and Coruscant must be controlled.  You have been granted 15,000 credits to prepare for this assault.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_30_INTRO_E,Imperial forces have managed to flee to the fringes of the galaxy.  Due to the strain of war and mismanagement by corrupt Imperial officials, you have only 5,000 credits left to retake the Core Worlds and the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_30_INTRO_R,The Alliance has managed to push the Empire from the Core Worlds, but several outlying worlds remain under their control.  Only 5,000 credits are available for military funding.  Recapturing some of the pirate controlled worlds will help with our income.  Remember that the ultimate goal is to vanquish the last bastions of the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_35_INTRO_E,The Empire has underestimated the resourcefulness of the Rebellion.  While we were fighting battles on the outer rim, several Core worlds have fallen to Rebel attacks.  As a result, Imperial forces have been fractured.  The Rebel presence persists in every corner of the galaxy.  You have 6,000 credits to use for the reconstruction of Imperial forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_35_INTRO_R,War is raging throughout the galaxy.  There have been several battles with the Empire and the Alliance is now spread very thin across the galaxy.  Many Rebel worlds are cut off from each other.  An attack can come at any time at any location.  Act quickly and use your initial 6,000 credits to defend your foothold in the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_44_INTRO_E,A Rebel uprising has taken place on many of the Outer Rim worlds.  The 10,000 credits at your disposal should be used to destroy all traces of the Rebellion and reestablish control of the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_44_INTRO_R,Many worlds have sworn allegiance to the Alliance, but the Empire sees the Rebellion as a much greater threat than ever before and as such will be directing large scale attacks against Alliance-held worlds.  Use your initial 10,000 credits wisely to upgrade and expand your forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_50_INTRO_E,Coruscant is the center of Empire, both literally and figuratively.  While the outlying systems claim fealty, the Emperor wishes to take a more active role in their control.  Use these 8,000 credits to take the might of the Empire wherever you can.  You may run across small pockets of a newly-formed Rebellion - crush them whenever possible.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_50_INTRO_R,The Alliance is small, holding only one planet as a base of operations.  The Empire has consolidated their presence in the center of the galaxy.  Both sides hold little advantage.  The Rebels must use every conceivable means to bring the galaxy back together under a banner of freedom.  You have 8,000 credits to bolster your forces, but survival depends on spreading the Rebellion to new planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_60_INTRO_E,Imperial forces have managed to push back the Rebellion in certain areas, but this sector remains stubborn.  Neither side has any real advantage.  Use the 20,000 credits provided to remove the Rebel forces in the area so that the Empire can concentrate on more important concerns.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_60_INTRO_R,The Rebellion and Empire have divided this area of the galaxy evenly, neither with any apparent advantage over the other.  You must use the 20,000 credits provided to liberate all of these worlds and bring freedom to the sector.

TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_00,Rebels are blatantly making their presence known in the streets!  Deploying some troops on the surface should remove any traitorous thoughts from their heads.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_01,There can be no diplomacy with Rebels!  Deploy some troops and show them how we negotiate!
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_02,This planet is at risk of falling into the hands of the Rebellion!  Mount a defense that will send them crawling back into their holes.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_03,Removing their land bases in the area would go a long way in helping us keep the Rebellion out of our space.  See to it.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_04,We have found the Rebel leader Mon Mothma.   Go now and remove the plague that has infested the Empire once and for all!
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_05,This last bastion of Rebel hope will quickly fade once we have eliminated their final base of operation.   Go now and do the Emperor's bidding.   Our  complete victory is at hand!
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_00,Our intelligence officers have discovered that a hostile fleet has evaded our orbital defenses and are landing their forces.  I need you to scout the area and find a weakness.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_01,The best defense is a good offense.  Go out and capture all the landing locations.  The enemy will be unable to send in reinforcements and will fall to our greater numbers.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_02,Rebel cells are showing their faces across the galaxy.  We can't allow them to burrow into the Empire like worms.  Show them that their aggressions against the Empire will not be tolerated.

TEXT_SPEECH_ORDER66_CORUSCANT_PALPATINE_2,They don't trust you, Anakin.
TEXT_SPEECH_ORDER66_CORUSCANT_PALPATINE_3,Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force. My mentor taught me everything about the Force. Even the nature of the dark side. If one is to understand the great mystery one must study all its aspects not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.
TEXT_SPEECH_ORDER66_CORUSCANT_PALPATINE_4,Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council. Are you going to kill me?
TEXT_SPEECH_ORDER66_CORUSCANT_PALPATINE_5,I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus makes you stronger.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_01,Hint: This non-interactive tutorial will provide you with the information needed to play land-based skirmish games within Star Wars: Empire at War.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_02,Hint: Let's begin with unit production.  Acquiring units is critical to achieving victory in any skirmish game.  To purchase new units select a structure, and then click on the icon of the unit you wish to build.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_03,Hint: Whenever a unit has been built, it will appear within your reinforcement pool.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_04,Hint: It's important to note that units are not produced directly from your base structures.  Instead, all units are added to your reinforcement pool, so that they may be deployed as reinforcements.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_05,Hint: To purchase an upgrade, simply click on any of the available upgrade icons found within the command bar.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_06,Hint: During team games all upgrades are shared among teammates.  Whenever an upgrade is being purchased, all of the players on a team will be able to view the status of that upgrade via an icon along the edge of the screen.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_07,Hint: During team games all upgrades are shared among teammates.  Whenever an upgrade is being purchased, all of the players on a team will be able to view the status of that upgrade via an icon along the edge of the screen.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_08,Hint: Whenever a structure is destroyed, all upgrades created at that structure will also be destroyed.  This makes it extremely critical to protect your structures.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_09,Hint: Advancing your technology level is also extremely important in land based skirmish games. Higher technology levels grant access to stronger units, upgrades, and heroes. Technology upgrades can be purchased directly from your Command Center 
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_10,Hint: To purchase a technology upgrade, simply click on the technology upgrade icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_11,Hint: When a technology upgrade is under construction, it will occupy a slot within your unit production queue.  A technology icon will then appear at the edge of the screen, informing teammates that your technology level has been upgraded.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_12,Hint: When a technology upgrade is under construction, it will occupy a slot within your unit production queue.  A technology icon will then appear the edge of the screen, informing teammates that your technology level has being upgraded.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_13,Hint: During a land-based skirmish game, your income is generated from Mining Facilities and Resource Pads.  The more Mining Facilities and Resource Pads that you own, the more credits you will receive.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_14,Hint: Mining Facilities distribute Credits equally to all players on a team.  These structures can be found scattered throughout the battlefield, and must be captured before they may be activated.  Mining Facilities are contested structures - this means that all enemy units in the immediate area must be eliminated before a Mining Facility may be activated.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_15,Hint: To activate a Mining Facility, left-click on the Mining Facility pad, and then click on the activation icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_16,Hint: Resource Pads serve as secondary source of income in land based skirmish games. While they do not produce nearly as many Credits as a Mining Facility would, the use of a Resource Pad can potentially swing the tide of a battle into your favor .  To activate a resource pad, left-click on the resource pad and left-click on the activation icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_17,Hint: As in standard game modes, Reinforcement Points play a critical role on the battlefield.  As you gain control of more Reinforcement Points you will be able to deploy even more reinforcements throughout the battlefield.  Reinforcement Points are contested structures - this means that all enemy units in the immediate area must be eliminated before a Reinforcement Point may be used.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_18,Hint: To capture a reinforcement point, simply move your units into the vicinity. While your units are near the Reinforcement Point it will transition into your control.  Once a Reinforcement Point is under your control, you will be able to deploy reinforcements within range of the Reinforcement Point.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_19,Hint: Lastly, to achieve victory in a land-based skirmish game you must either destroy all enemy units and structures, or control all Reinforcement Points.  Remember that the victory conditions for land-based skirmish games may change depending on the map and game settings, so it's important to know what they are before entering into any skirmish game.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT06_20,Hint: Now that you are familiar with the basics to land based skirmish games let's examine the space skirmish game mode.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_01,Hint: This non-interactive tutorial will provide you with the information needed to play space-based skirmish games within Star Wars: Empire at War.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_02,Hint: Let's begin with unit production.  Acquiring units is critical to achieving victory in any skirmish game.  To purchase new units select a structure, and then click on the icon of the unit you wish to build.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_03,Hint: Whenever a unit has been built, it will appear within your reinforcement pool.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_04,Hint: To purchase an upgrade, simply click on any of the available upgrade icons found within the command bar.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_05,Hint: During team games all upgrades are shared among teammates.  Whenever an upgrade is being purchased, all of the players on a team will be able to view the status of that upgrade via an icon along the edge of the screen.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_06,Hint: During team games all upgrades are shared among teammates.  Whenever an upgrade is being purchased, all of the players on a team will be able to view the status of that upgrade via an icon along the edge of the screen.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_07,Hint: Whenever your space station is destroyed, all upgrades created at that base will also be destroyed.  This makes it extremely critical to protect your space station.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_08,Hint: Advancing your technology level is also extremely important in space-based skirmish games. Higher technology levels grant access to stronger units, upgrades, and heroes. Technology upgrades can be purchased directly from your Space Station, in the form of base upgrades.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_09,Hint: To upgrade your station simply click on the space station upgrade icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_10,Hint: When a technology upgrade is under construction, it will occupy a slot within your unit production queue.  A technology icon will then appear the edge of the screen, informing teammates that your technology level has being upgraded.  When complete, your space station will grow in size to reflect the new changes.   
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_11,Hint: When a technology upgrade is under construction, it will occupy a slot within your unit production queue.  A technology icon will then appear the edge of the screen, informing teammates that your technology level has being upgraded.  When complete, your space station will grow in size to reflect the new changes.   
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_12,Hint: During a space-based skirmish game, your income is generated from Asteroid Mining Facilities.  The more Asteroid Mining Facilities that you own, the more credits you will receive.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_13,Hint: Asteroid Mining Facilities distribute Credits equally to all players on a team.  These structures can be found scattered throughout the battlefield, and must be captured before they may be activated.  Asteroid Mining Facilities are contested structures - this means that all enemy units in the immediate area must be eliminated before an Asteroid Mining Facility may be activated.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_14,Hint: To activate an Asteroid Mining Facility, left-click on the Asteroid Mining Facility pad, and then click on the activation icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_15,Hint: Unlike ground battles, reinforcements are not limited to Reinforcement Points. During a space-based skirmish game, you can deploy reinforcements at almost any location.  However, you cannot deploy reinforcements in hazardous terrain or within unexplored territory.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_MP_ACT07_16,Hint: Lastly, to achieve victory in a space-based skirmish game you must either destroy all enemy units, structures, or both.  Remember that the victory conditions for space-based skirmish games may change depending on the map and game settings, so it's important to know what they are before entering into any skirmish game.

TEXT_TAR_EVENT_AMBUSH_02,You managed to salvage a victory.  You manage your forces disgracefully.  Hopefully the addition of these forces will compensate for your ineptitude.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_AMBUSH_03,You have failed to heed my warning and your resulting defeat brings disgrace to both of us in the eyes of the Emperor.  Do not fail me again.

TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_00,Apparently the Rebellion takes us for fools.  They seem to believe that we are unaware of their forces assembling on our borders.  I want you meet their attack with a little surprise of our own.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_01,Rebel ships have entered hyperspace.  I expect you to be there in force to greet them when they exit.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_02,You expect congratulations?  The attempted Rebellion assault was beneath pathetic and your response, while satisfactory, was hardly impressive.   
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_03,You have failed to heed my warning and your resulting defeat brings disgrace to both of us in the eyes of the Emperor.  I will not tolerate more losses.  The Rebellion fleet must be wiped out.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CREDIT_WINDFALL_00,I have discovered some unspent credits in the Imperial coffers.  See to it that these credits are spent wisely.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CREDITS_00,Your handling of Imperial funds is admirable.  Unfortunately, we need to hold a larger surplus in reserve if we are to succeed over the long term.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CREDITS_01,Your actions have been satisfactory.  Our scientists have put together a few new weapons that I need tested.  I will require a full report of course.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_DEFECTION_01,We strive to remove all traces of treachery and rebellion from our galaxy.  One of our lieutenants has been caught selling supplies to the Black Sun Pirates.

TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_02,My fleet has failed me.  They were weak and deserved the punishment they received.  Rest easy today, commander, for tomorrow I will return to exact my vengeance.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_03,Yet again you have failed the Empire.  You have allowed a Rebellion fleet to defeat you on your own territory.  If you do not regroup and exterminate these criminals, you will learn how Lord Vader deals with incompetence.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_00,I have word from Lord Vader of a Rebel gathering.  Apparently, he has sensed that many of the Rebellion’s leaders are gathered together on one planet.  This is our chance to crush the Rebellion.  Take a fleet and assassinate these dissenters.

TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SMUGGLER_01,Bounty hunters have tracked down Han Solo.  The traitorous smuggler is apparently in the company of the Rebellion.  This scoundrel has stolen countless credits and supplies from the Empire.  He must be punished for his crimes.  Destroy him and any Rebellion accomplices.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SMUGGLER_02,Your actions have been successful.  You have managed to cleanse the Rebel presence from this planet, however, word comes to us that Han Solo managed to survive.  You are treading on thin ice, commander.  Due to your incompetence, I will finish the job and take the planet surface.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SMUGGLER_TITLE,Rebel Smuggler
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_STRUCTURE_00,A base alone cannot protect worlds from the traitorous Rebellion.  Fleets, ground troops and secondary structures all play a part in defense.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_STRUCTURE_01,I am sure the Emperor would thank you if he was present.  I believe you will find these new troops useful.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TECH_WINDFALL_00,Your service to the Empire is noted.  While you continue your extermination of the Rebels, I'd like you to field test this new tech.  Your tech level has been raised.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAITOR_01,We have discovered a traitor in our midst.  He was discovered funneling classified information to the Rebellion.  Incompetence has allowed him to escape to Rebel territory.  Destroy all Rebellion resistance on the Rebellion planet harboring him.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAITOR_02,The traitor has been found and justice is being administered.  Let this be a lesson as to what happens to those who turn their backs on the Empire.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAITOR_TITLE,Imperial Traitor
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAP_00,Once again the Rebellion shows its laughable grasp of military strategy.  They have left one of their traitorous worlds poorly defended and I am assigning you to make them pay for this error.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAP_01,Your lack of urgency has allowed the Rebel scum to recognize their weakness and construct a defense!  Were my orders somehow unclear?  I will be personally informing the Emperor of your incompetence.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAP_02,It's a trap!  Bolster your defenses to survive the battle.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UNIT_WINDFALL_00,Your actions have been adequately successful.  Our scientists have put together a few new weapons that I need tested.  I will require a full report of course.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UNITS_00,Credits sitting unspent do not work for the Empire; only the armies that money can produce are useful.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UNITS_01,You have saved me time and resources.  It is only fair that I allow you to share in the surplus funding.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_00,Our space stations and ground bases are the backbone of the galaxy's defenses.  We need to increase our strength if we are to teach the Rebellion that their cause is a losing proposition.  Upgrade a starbase to strengthen our defenses.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_01,You handled that well.  I am directing some of the Imperial funds recovered from the Rebellion to your accounts.  Use them well.
